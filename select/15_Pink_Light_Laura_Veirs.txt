Sorry, I was cruel, I was protecting myself
Drifting along with my swords out flying
Tattering my own cells and I tattered yours too
Took you and wrapped you around me like a spell

Oh, how now the cold seeps in, oh
Oh, how now I cast you into the wind

Wracked by winter, I'm cupping my coals in the sand
Growing like a starlight 'cross the garden of night I'll think
Bones look lonely, memories surround me
Good times, skeletons are kicking at the ground

Oh, how the night drags on, oh
But I think I see a pink light and the coming of dawn
Oh, how the night drags on, oh
But in the fading of the Constellations I am growing strong

In the fading of the Constellations I am growing strong
In the fading of the Constellations I am growing strong
