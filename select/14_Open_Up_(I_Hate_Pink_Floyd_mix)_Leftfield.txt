Burn burn, burn burn
Burn burn burn

Open up, now open up

You lied, you faked, you cheated, you changed the stakes
Magnet toss that pie in the sky, unrehearsed, let the bubbles burst
All in all, a three-ring circus of unity with parody
Tragedy or comedy, probably publicity

Open up, make room for me
Now open up, make room for me

Lose myself, inside your schemes
Go for the money, honey, not the screen
Be a movie star, blah blah blah
Go the whole hog, be bigger than God

Burn Hollywood burn, taking down Tinseltown
Burn Hollywood burn, burn down into the ground
Burn Hollywood burn, burn Hollywood burn
Take down Tinseltown, burn down to the ground

Down, into the ground

Burn burn burn
Burn burn burn
Burn burn burn...
